    To understand this function assume, r > 0 as if r = 0 then nothing is changed. If r < 0, then jobSetA(r) = jobSetB(-r), 
    so we can just call updateMeasure(prevMeasure, -userResponse, jobSetB, jobSetA) to obtain a case where r > 0.
    How the function works is for every question d in jobSetB we reduce the probability of d being chosen by constructing 
    a new measure and setting newMeasure({d}) = (1-r)*prevMeasure({d}). So if the user strongly agrees (r = 1), then we reduce 
    the probability of detailed quesitons in disagreement from being chosen to 0.

   Then, we look at the total probability removed from the questions not in agreement, divide that value by the number of 
    questions in agreement, and then update the measure of each question in agreement accordingly
